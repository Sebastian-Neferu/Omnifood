Practice website for learning HTML5&amp;CSS3.
Coded along as part of the Udemy course "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3". 
For websites that I coded entirely on my own, see my "Art Gallery" and "Personal Website" repositories.

The website was coded with a functional contact form. However, given that Git Pages does not support php files, that functionality was removed to enable the website to be exhibited here.
